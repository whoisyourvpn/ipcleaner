## IPCleaner - CSV Data Cleaner

IPCleaner is a Windows Forms application developed for niche, in-house projects. It offers functionality to process and clean CSV files containing IP addresses and associated data. 

### Features:

- **File Selection**: Users can select the desired CSV file for cleaning through a simple file dialog.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: The application reads the CSV, processes the data by splitting and trimming based on specific criteria, and subsequently produces a cleaned CSV file.
  
- **Dynamic UI**: Controls within the application adjust their positions based on form resizing to enhance user experience.

### Use Case:

This application was specifically crafted for internal projects where there's a need to process CSV files with particular data patterns. It may not be suited for general purposes, but it serves as a good example of how to design a simple, yet effective, CSV processing tool using the CsvHelper library and Windows Forms in .NET.

### Note:

While this application serves a specific use-case, it can be a foundation for more extensive CSV processing tasks or can be adapted to fit other data cleaning requirements.
